This is an application that will listen to your voice and search Flickr for pictures relevant to your speech query.

To start the app, navigate to this directory, run "bundle install" and "be shotgun" in the console.

(The Sinatra Skeleton was used here so we could use the local machine as a server.  Using HTML and JavaScript files without a server resulted in certain speech recognition methods being blocked by Chrome.)
